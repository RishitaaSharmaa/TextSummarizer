This question reflects how the desire to live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the dream of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuzama village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical connectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of products from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the transformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages are empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and with the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This includes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, primary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted in large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been developed into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have worked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products with support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co-operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen similar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PURA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agriculture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. We have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and reduced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should empower the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green revolution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists and industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appointments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mind. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked God, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and help. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in front \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraja’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtrapati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the devastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the problem rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

While various reconstruction and rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even though there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothing like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few verses called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South \\nAfrica.

In these three experiences, I personally felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man made. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regiments, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence Forces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night, Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counter any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defence Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in augmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Foundation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of students in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Administration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talked to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who related how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the 540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resource on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through value based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuzama village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical connectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of products from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the transformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages are empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and with the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This includes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, primary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted in large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups.

      "Former President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, is bidding farewell after completing his five-year term. He expresses his gratitude and delight in having worked with people from diverse backgrounds. He shares his experiences and key messages that he conveyed during his tenure, which include:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He recalls a significant question from a schoolgirl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020, and assures her that it is possible. The speech seems to be a reflective and inspirational message from the former President, highlighting his priorities and vision for India's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, called it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution in the nation and that they would work on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "In simpler terms: The speaker thanked the person for a good question and promised to take their dream to the top national authorities and work on making it happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural resources to achieve a developed India. The speaker, likely a high-ranking government official or President, shares their experience of visiting a village in Nagaland and witnessing the positive impact of empowered village councils. They stress the need for physical connectivity, such as quality roads, to enable the movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also highlights a successful initiative, Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) project, which has brought urban amenities to 65 rural villages, resulting in employment generation and entrepreneurship. The speaker's key message is that empowering villages and providing them with necessary infrastructure and resources can lead to a prosperous and developed India, where the aspirations of the youth can be fulfilled. The goal is to create a safe, proud, and prosperous India, where the youth can thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker describes a successful rural development project called Periyar PURA, which has:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Generated employment and created entrepreneurs through 1000 self-help groups\n",
      "* Developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land for farming and other activities\n",
      "* Supported the production of internationally competitive products, such as lifestyle products, with the help of experts from Japan\n",
      "\n",
      "The project has become a sustainable economic development model for the region. The speaker believes that India needs 7000 such projects to bridge the rural-urban divide and considers \"Seed to Food\" as the backbone for agricultural growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers from various states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in the gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the need to double agricultural production with limited resources and improve the nation's economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They expressed confidence that with the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries, the nation can increase its agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a meeting with a person, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs but had a radiant and happy demeanor. Despite his physical limitations, Vidwan expressed gratitude to those who had helped him and requested to sing in front of the speaker, showcasing his confidence and positivity. The speaker highlights Vidwan's inspiring story as an example of overcoming problems and succeeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring stories. The first is about a physically challenged person who, despite his disability, has a remarkable talent for music and wants to share it with others to inspire them. With the support of his parents, teachers, and others, he has achieved great things, including performing at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Jammu & Kashmir, who showed remarkable resilience and courage in the face of a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited a village, Urusa, which had been adopted by the Western Air Command for relief efforts. Despite severe losses, the villagers praised the support of the Army, Air Force, and state government, and demonstrated a positive attitude, taking control of their problems rather than letting them overwhelm them. The overall message is one of overcoming adversity through partnership, positive attitude, and perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes the resilience and courage of people in the face of natural disasters. The speaker recounts two experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Earthquake relief efforts**: The speaker visited a village affected by an earthquake and was impressed by the bravery of children and villagers who participated in relief operations alongside the Armed Forces. The speaker also witnessed the on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to victims by government authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tsunami recovery in Car Nicobar Islands**: In 2005, the speaker visited the Car Nicobar Islands after a tsunami and was touched by the courage and resilience of the tribal islanders. Despite suffering significant losses, the islanders had taken in affected victims as their own children, and the speaker composed a poem, \"Sea Waves\", which was sung by the islanders with enthusiasm and courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of courage and resilience in the face of adversity and the role of connectivity in societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed a \"Pan African e-Network\" to connect 53 African countries through a seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network at a cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 12 universities (7 from India, 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 17 super specialty hospitals (12 from India, 5 from Africa)\n",
      "* 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "* 53 tele-education centers\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already started, with Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to Ethiopian students and specialists from CARE Hospital providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker discusses three main topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **India-Africa collaboration**: India has been providing live tele-consultation services to doctors in Ethiopia and plans to connect the heads of state in 53 African countries through a pan-African network, showcasing India's expertise in technology and its role in bringing about societal transformation in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation**: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, who work tirelessly to protect the nation, often in adverse conditions. The speaker highlights their personal experiences with soldiers, sailors, and air warriors and acknowledges the valour and commitment of the defense forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Youth movement for a developed India**: The speaker mentions a recent meeting with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working to empower youth to become enlightened citizens, aligning with the goal of a \"Developed India 2020\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is impressed with the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is transforming youth into enlightened citizens through training programs. The foundation, in partnership with district administrations, has been training students in Andhra Pradesh, with noticeable impacts on students' self-discipline, relationships with parents and teachers, and sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker cites examples of positive change, such as a student leader who helped her father quit smoking after attending a training camp. The speaker believes that India's 540 million youth under 25 are a powerful resource that must be empowered through value-based education and leadership. The speaker concludes by highlighting the richness of Indian tradition and culture, and the efforts of various agencies to promote positive change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage while pursuing economic growth. They express confidence in India's progress, citing the country's natural resources, hardworking people, and large youth population (540 million). The speaker envisions India becoming a developed nation by 2020 and encourages citizens to work towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines a plan for a developed India by 2020, with the following key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Harmony between agriculture, industry, and services\n",
      "4. Education with values for all meritorious students, regardless of background\n",
      "5. India as a top destination for scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by inspiring citizens, especially the youth, to aim high and work towards making India a developed nation, citing a poem that suggests that with determination, anything is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker envisions a nation with:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Universal access to quality healthcare\n",
      "* Transparent and corruption-free governance\n",
